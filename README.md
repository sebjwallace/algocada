# BOOTHSHAW

This repository is an arcade exploring games related to programming. It seems fitting to associate the name to a couple of programming & gaming pioneers:
- Kathleen Booth: the inventor of assembly language (which inspires the games in this repo).
- Carol Shaw: the first ever game programmer.
